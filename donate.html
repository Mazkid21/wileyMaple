Thank you for your past support of my skiing career.
<br>
<br>
After being forced to miss the 2016/2017 ski season to recover from an knee and back surgery, I am back at it and making a push for World Cup success and the Olympics in South Korea. 
<br>
<br>
Last winter I attended Westminster College in Salt Lake City where I maintained a 3.9 GPA while rehabbing at the USST training center in Park City. Unfortunately, this spring the Ski Team opted not to rename me to the USST as they thought I could not come back from injury and time off of snow. While returning to a high level of athletic achievement after injury is never certain, after a period of introspection, my passion and confidence to return to ski racing continues to burn brightly. Freed from the USST dictating my training, I returned home to Aspen for the first summer in over a decade and changed my training. Instead of focusing training in a gym and weight room, I opted to do moderate weight training at the Aspen Valley Ski/Snowboard Club, work with the extraordinary physical therapist Glenn McLeod and play any sport I could - mountain bike, running, hiking, softball, soccer, hockey, volleyball, skate boarding and dirt biking. Skiing is unlike any sport on Earth with infinitely changing variables that require diverse athletic skills. Returning to form as a complete athlete, able to adapt to change and follow the movements and patterns of so many different sports will allow me to succeed on the constantly changing variables that are inherent in World Cup Downhill racing.  Thanks to changing up my training, my body feels better than it has in almost a decade. In August I was invited to join the US World Cup Speed Team in Chile. After over 1 1/3 years off skis, I quickly got up to speed and was competitive with the US team athletes and other World Cup racers.
My body held up better than it has in years and I was able to ski double training sessions 25 out of 30 days confirming to my coaches that I still have the speed and drive to be competitive. Chile was a success and combined with pre-season camp at Copper Mountain, Colorado I skied more this prep period than I have in 5 years! The US Ski team has awarded me World Cup starts in Lake Louise, Beaver Creek and invited me to join them in Europe.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, short of being an A team athlete ranked in the top 25 in the world, training for and competing on the World Cup costs in excess of $30,000 for travel, lodging, training and racing. 
<br>
<br>
My ability to compete at a world class level has been made possible by you and the extraordinary support the community has provided over the years. This year I have opted to raise funds as directly as possible to avoid the fees fundraising organizations require. 
<br>
<br>
Please help me compete on the World Cup circuit and for a spot on the Olympic team. Contributions can be made via
